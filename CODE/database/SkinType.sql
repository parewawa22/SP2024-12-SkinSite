INSERT INTO SkinType (sktName, sktDescription) VALUES
	('Oily','Oily skin tends to produce excess sebum, leading to a shiny appearance, especially in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). \n It is prone to enlarged pores and is more susceptible to blemishes and breakouts due to the buildup of oil and debris.'),
	('Combination','Combination skin exhibits both dry and oily characteristics due to the uneven distribution of sebaceous and sweat glands. \n The T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) tends to be oilier, while the cheeks are typically normal or dry, requiring tailored care to balance these varying skin needs.'),
	('Normal','Normal skin is well-balanced, with neither excessive oiliness nor dryness. It features a smooth texture, small pores, and a naturally healthy complexion. \n This skin type is less prone to sensitivity or breakouts, making it one of the easiest to manage.'),
	('Dry','Dry skin lacks moisture, often feeling tight, rough, or flaky. Itâ€™s prone to sensitivity, premature aging, and damage from pollutants and UV rays due to insufficient hydration and slower cell turnover.'),
	('Sensitive','Sensitive skin is easily irritated by factors like weather, skincare products, or pollutants. \n It may result from a weakened skin barrier or underlying conditions and often reacts with redness, itching, or burning sensations.'),
	('Acne-prone','Acne-prone is a skin that is more likely to develop acne, including pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, or cystic lesions. People with acne-prone skin typically experience frequent breakouts due to factors such as Excess oil production, Bacterial growth, Clogged pores, Genetics, and Hormonal changes.')
